Midas is a reserach prototype to help us explore a _new programming medium_, where you we provide tools to help you move smoothly between coding and **interactions on visualizations**. Now that sounds rather abstract, so let's get started on the demo, which will give you concrete examples for when you might want to move from code to interactions and back.\n",

Until you are done with the tutorial, please do *not* randomly click on the interface, and only do ask is asked in our tutorial. This will help you understand.\n",
