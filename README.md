# Midas Experiment

Welcome to Midas experiment!

You can find the consent form under the title `consent.pdf` in this directory.

## Requirements

**Skills**: you should know how to do data analysis, and basic modeling/"machine learning".  Specifically, you should already be familiar with dataframes (e.g., `pandas`), know how to read basic visualizations (e.g., bar chart, scatter plot), and know how to build a classification algorithm (e.g., `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`).

**Technical**: you should have **Python 3.7, Jupyter**, and **Chrome** installed on your computer.

## Setup

There will be no setup if you are participating with Yifan for the study---a link to a cloud hosted Jupyter notebook instance will be sent to you.

If you are trying this out your self, make sure that you have [midas](https://github.com/yifanwu/midas) installed.
