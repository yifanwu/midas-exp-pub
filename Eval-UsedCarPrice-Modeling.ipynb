    "* **Sampling for faster interactions**: The original data may be too large to be analyzed interactive---you may see a large delay. However, you can sample a subset of data to do interactive analysis first---`sample_train_df = train_df.sample(k=500)`, and then verify your results on the full dataset with static visualizations. You can record the query used by copy-ing out from the cell dropdown (ðŸ“‹), or directly snapping the visualization (ðŸ“·), which will contain the code to derive the data in the comment.\n",
